					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>This was an idea I've had for a long time. In downtown Madison, there are so many drink specials to keep track of throughout the week that it gets difficult finding a place to let loose on a small budget. Outlined while having talks with friends after work, sitting on top of barstools during difficult financial times, this app idea looked to ease our troubles.

					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>I started researching what it takes to build an app and what similar apps were doing to provide the information. Luckily, Android apps use Java, a programming language that I used the most during college. Now it was about learning in-depth how Android OS works from a developer's standpoint.<br><br>
					I wanted the app to be intuitive and informative, displaying all necessary pieces so the user can easily find what they need. First, I needed an icon that users can recognize and make the connection to Madison and drinking. So I started sketching out designs for the icon, as well as figuring out ways to put all the information on the same space without having too much clutter in the app.</p>

					<h3>design details</h3>
					<p>The icon I came up with is a full beer glass with a capitol on it. The shape of the glass is a well-known symbol to represent beer, and the capitol is an homage to the capitol building in Madison.<br><br>
					The color scheme was based off the color of the beer. The primary blue, #0060a7 is a direct complement to the orange, and the rest of the blues are shades it. The primary blue made the icon stand out and fits into the material style on current Android apps.<br><br>
					Users can access information easily with a simple interface. The app automatically opens up to the current day. Users can see a photo of the bar, its name, hours, and distance away from their current location. Clicking the bar opens a drop-down list of their specials that day, along with the times they are available, and a link to Google Maps to get directions.<br><br>
					They can also swipe left or right to switch days of the week, sort bars by their title or distance away, and filter the bars by the kind of specials they're having. All of these functions are available on the home screen.

					<h3>prototype</h3>
					<p>Learning mobile development is a lot harder than the Java programs I had to make in college.<br><br>However, I did manage to scrap out a prototype. It uses one Main Activity and seven Fragments that represent the days of the week. To populate the bar list, it uses ExpandableListViews. These ExpandableListViews' headers and children are composed by connecting ArrayLists via a HashMap key. It works as intended for the most part, but it currently doesn't match the design I have for it and it's missing the sort and filter features.
					</p>

					<h3>epilogue</h3>
					<p>
					The app is on the shelf for now. I eventually want to populate the list using an SQL database, which would tremendously optimize the code. Right now, I have so many repetitive calls to add to the ArrayLists...it's disgusting.<br><br>
					Why is it on the shelf? My computer is an Early 2008 Macbook, so I had to use someone else's more recent laptop to make the prototype. But! I do have big plans to keep learning and update it in the future. For now you can check the prototype's code on my GitHub page.
