						<h3>overview</h3>
						<p>Snapchat has allowed for users to be able to create their own Snapchat Geofilters. At first, it was only available for public, communal areas, but it soon expanded to include personal events and businesses (for a fee). Both kinds of geofilters are excellent tools for marketing purposes, whether it be to promote your creative work to the masses or to expose others to a business event.</p>

						<h3>Mission</h3>
						<p>At the time I created my San Antonio filter, I didn't see a lot of other geofilters that included the two most recognizable landmarks of the city, in my opinion: the Alamo and the Hemisfair Tower. If they were included, they were only silhouettes in a skyline. I wanted to represent them in all their glory.<br><br>
						As for the Latin Night filter, it was done as part of a social media campaign to promote Blue Velvet Lounge's event every Thursday. It was aimed to enhance the experience of the customers that attended the event and the pictures they were taking on Snapchat so that their friends could get exposed to the business through their Story.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>These metrics were taken from the Snapchat website in July 2017.<br><br>
						The San Antonio filter was submitted in November 2016 and spproved two weeks later. I didn't start seeing it until January, but it could've been up longer and I just didn't notice. So far, it's been used over 275K times and seen over 12 million times. I never thought anything I created would reach this high of a scope. It's gratifying, and I hope more work reaches these numbers again.<br><br>
						The Latin Night filter was submitted for a one-night use, running from 9pm - 2am for the event. For the low amount of $5, almost 6K people were exposed to the business and the event, with a decent use rate to boot. This part of the social media campaign proved successful, showing that Snapchat geofilters are a viable opportunity for marketing if used correctly.
