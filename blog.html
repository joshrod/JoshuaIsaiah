							<p>It's important to keep up with trends and continue learning as a web developer and designer. Changes happen often in the industry, so I stay on top of them by listening to the experts making them happen through these three podcasts:<br><br>
							<a href="https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> - Karen McGrane and Ethan Marcotte discuss responsive web design and go in-depth into topics like SEO, content management, freelancing, and user experience with their special guests on the show. I recommend their podcast to get you thinking about all of the different challenges in web design and what the experts do to solve them.<br><br>
							<a href="http://www.36point.com" target="_blank">The Reflex Blue Show</a> - 36 Point describes themselves as a blogging network for designers, and their podcast invites industry experts that provide an insight to their experiences in design. They discuss important subjects like fonts, work presentation, and marketing in an engaging tone that makes every topic interesting.<br><br>
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks" target="_blank">The Futur</a> - I know this is a YouTube channel, but most of their content is structured like a podcast such that you won't need to watch the video to follow along. The Futur talks about a wide range of aspects, tackling challenges in web, typography, lettering, portfolios, and the business of design. They have well over a hundred videos and they upload frequently with quality content, so I recommend subscribing to stay up-to-date with their take on the industry.

							<p>According to the Ewing Marion Kaufmann Foundation, San Antonio has risen 8 spots to number 6 in the rankings of best cities for startup activity in 2016, as reported by the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2017/05/19/san-antonio-moves-up-ranking-for-new-entrepreneurs.html" target="_blank">San Antonio Business Journal</a>. As a current resident, I say that this news is promising from the perspective of an emerging professional in the Information Technology industry.<br><br>
							When speaking of programming and technological innovation in San Antonio, you usually hear of companies like USAA, Rackspace, and, more recently, Oracle...but not much else. This is almost always followed up by agreeing that Austin is a better place for Information Technology, which happens to be number 2 on the list.<br><br>
							However, if the data provided is accurate, this could spell out good news for fellow entry-level professionals looking for employment in the area. Instead of having to look at bigger companies to start your IT career, searching for startups that require your expertise could prove to be a great idea.<br><br>
							I think there is a catch, though: these opportunities may not arrive for a good while. It takes time for new startups to get some footing, and even more before they are able to hire outside assistance. There are numerous companies already out there that have reached this stage, but stay optimistic with the knowledge that there are more opportunities abound if things don't quite go your way.<br><br>
							TL;DR - If you're looking for IT employment in San Antonio, try searching for opportunities at startup businesses.

							<h1>6 questions to go over with your client before creating their website</h1>
						</div>
						<div class="blogdate">

							<p>When meeting with clients that need a website, I find it incredibly important to have clear communication. I strive to leave the meeting with a solid grasp of the site they require and the background of the project. Found through some trial and error, these are some questions that have helped me understand clients better and optimized the time used to complete the website:<br><br>
							<span class="question">What do you or your company do?</span><br>
							Simple and straightforward: learn about the client and their motivations. A website is an extension of your client, so getting to know about them will make it easier to create an online presence based on their values.<br><br>
							<span class="question">What goals do you want your website to help meet?</span><br>
							A meaningless website is doomed to fail. Have the client list out their goals and then prioritize them. This perfectly outlines the purpose of the website and clearly defines the call-to-action that needs to be there.<br><br> 
							<span class="question">Who is the target audience?</span><br>
							Lay out who the primary users are going to be. This helps you plan out the website's interface and user experience. I highly recommend going through sample scenarios where you picture how different visitors will use the website.<br><br>
							<span class="question">Who are your competitors and how are you different?</span><br>
							Competitors may already have websites available, and more than likely they'll have goals similar to the client's. By researching the competition, you can focus on a strategy that brings more visitors to the site, and increase their retention rate with their uniqueness so that the client's services are used more.<br><br>
							<span class="question">What are the pros and cons of your current website?</span><br>
							Don't be afraid to make things easier for yourself. Evaluate what's working or not with the client's current website. This way, you can determine what website features should be kept and how they can be incorporated into your product.<br><br>
							<span class="question">What do you NOT want your website to look like?</span><br>
							Collaborate with the client so that you can create a website you both are happy with and will work as needed. In my experience, it's a whole lot easier to figure out what a client DOESN'T like rather than what they do. Save yourself having to make extra revisions with this question.

							<p>Recently in web development, it has become a requirement for a website to be responsive. It is driven by the growing availability of phones and tablets, so much that now things like CSS and <a href="https://moz.com/blog/seo-of-responsive-web-design" target="_blank">SEO have grown to incorporate them</a>. Yes, it's great that planning to include mobile screens has become a priority, but is it necessary to have a mobile-first mindset when creating a website? I don't think so.<br><br>
							One of the main topics that needs focus when thinking about launching a website is functionality. Ideally, a website should function the same way across all platforms. But here's the problem: not all screens and platforms are the same. Something that works for a phone doesn't necessarily work for desktops, and vice versa.<br><br>
							This means that, for example, a website using an interface that only scales up responsively as the screen size increases doesn't really work. While it literally functions the same way, it neglects the difference of the platforms used to access the website. Scrolling down endlessly for information is much easier and faster to do on a phone than on a laptop. It's a great idea, but it's unrealistic. Similarly, a complicated website may sacrifice features or exclude content to prioritize accessibility for users with smaller devices. Now, to access the full site, a desktop has to be used.<br><br>
							So what should you do? Ditch the mobile-first approach and plan for all screen sizes simultaneously. When thinking of content or features to add, always ask how it fits on the most extreme screen sizes. Remember, websites are for people first, and they use more than phones to go online.<br><br>
							TL;DR - "(Not) All screen sizes are created equal." - Abraham Linkin

							<p>There are 16,777,216 colors to choose from when using RGB, and picking a few that work well together can sometimes be a hassle. Even with some knowledge in color theory, you might reach a point where you're saying, "Ok...I know I need a blue here, but which one?" Whenever I get into these situations, I find myself turning to these places that help strengthen my color selections.<br><br>
							<a href="https://material.io/color" target="_blank">material.io</a> - Material design is found everywhere on mobile devices, and Google is one of the masters of this style. Fortunately, they have made a comprehensive set of guidelines that include a selection of preferred colors. I recommend using this site as a way to see how your color selection functions on mobile screens, especially if you're designing an app.<br><br>
							<a href="https://coolors.co" target="_blank">Coolors.co</a> - This web app is a great and easy way to discover a color palette when you're feeling uninspired. Coolors allows you to randomly generate color palettes, search palettes with filters applied, and view palettes that other users have submitted.<br><br>
							<a href="https://uigradients.com" target="_blank">uiGradients</a> - The use of gradients is a current trend that has been adopted by the likes of Facebook and Instagram, as well as many landing pages that I have personally come across. uiGradients has a good selection of gradients and allows you to copy their CSS easily for web use.<br><br>
							Bonus:<br>
							<a href="https://color.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Color CC</a> - One of the only services that Adobe doesn't charge for, Color CC helps you find a palette based off a selected color. You can also discover palettes from ones that users have submitted, and since it's Adobe, there are more to choose from.
