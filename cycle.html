						<p>Cyc Fitness in Madison is an exercise-bike fitness chain that occasionally has themed rides for its class participants. In collaboration with Lambda Theta Phi, a Latin-themed ride was planned for May 5th. It was up to the latter organization to fill the bike reservations, and my duty to make the social media marketing materials to distribute.</p>

						<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>
						<p>Cyc Fitness uses a minimalistic design on their website and marketing photos. Their primary colors are black and white, and their logo resembles someone riding a bike upside-down.<br><br>
						The challenge of creating the social media marketing materials was to keep the feel of the brand, the minimalistic features of its design, while having features that represented the Latin-themed ride.</p>

						<h3>Creating the Artwork</h3>
						<p>I decided that the main focus would be a bicycle wheel. Although most exercise-bikes don't have spokes, making the wheel with them included allowed me to easily show that cycling was taking place. I cast a drop shadow on the "ground" behind it to give the flyer some depth, while staying true to the minimalistic feel of the design.<br><br>
						Luckily, I was also given the ability to name the event. With "Cycle" sounding so similar to "Cinco," I was able to place a small Mexican flag at the end of the event's title to really emphasize a Latin theme.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>Not only was I tasked to make the flyer and social media materials, I also had the pleasure to mix the music live during the class. The marketing worked as hoped, with the class running out of exercise bikes to participate in the ride.<br><br>
						It turns out having seemingly disconnected talents can be extremely beneficial when they come together. Not only was I able to be a major part of the planning for the event, I also had the most fun doing it.</p>
