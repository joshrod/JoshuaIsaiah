						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Cyc Fitness in Madison is an exercise-bike fitness chain that occasionally has themed rides for its class participants. In collaboration with Lambda Theta Phi, a Latin-themed ride was planned for May 5th. It was up to the latter organization to fill the bike reservations, and my duty to make the social media marketing materials to distribute.</p>

						<h3>Design Details</h3>
						<p>I decided that the main focus would be a bicycle wheel. Although most exercise-bikes don't have spokes, making the wheel with them included allowed me to easily show that cycling was taking place. I cast a drop shadow on the "ground" behind it to give the flyer some depth, while staying true to the minimalistic feel of the design.<br><br>
						Luckily, I was also given the ability to name the event. With "Cycle" sounding so similar to "Cinco," I was able to place a small Mexican flag at the end of the event's title to really emphasize a Latin theme.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>Using the flyer together with a Facebook Cover Photo and square image to use on Instagram provided multiple avenues for the event's marketing.<br><br>
						The inclusion of a cover photo along with the changes in Facebook's algorithm for sharing posts allowed members of the organization to change their cover photos on a schedule that displayed the event at the top of friends' News Feed at least once a day.<br><br>
						The marketing worked as hoped, with the class running out of exercise bikes to participate in the ride. Not only was I tasked to make the promotional materials, but I also mixed music live during the themed ride. Definitely a win-win.
