						<p>Montoya Electric LLC is a family-owned electric company based in Chicago, Illinois. They perform high quality, efficient work and service residential and commercial areas excellently.<br><br>
						I am currently (April 28th, 2017) tasked with modernizing their company van with a design that is cost-efficient and eye-catching, as well as creating a website that fulfills their business requirements effectively.

						<h3>Creating the Design</h3>
						<p>The client wanted something that made people double-take on either the logo or the van. He had a great idea to use a circuit diagram as the main part of the design to give his company an identity.<br><br>
						After converting the words of the logo itself into a diagram, I expanded on an idea that the client mentioned to try as a last resort: to make the Chicago skyline with the diagram's elements.<br><br>
						This was the winner. The client and I continued to work together to figure out the design's placement and colors, which eventually manifested into the van shown above.<br><br>
						We are currently waiting on quotes to make sure the artwork fits the company's budget, and will revise it in case it does not.

						<h3>Creating the Website</h3>
						<p>The website is a work in progress at the moment. We are currently in the process of researching competitors, targeting company goals, and gathering content so that the site can optimally benefit the business.<br><br>
						I will then make a mockup of a user-friendly design and report back to the client before going on to code the final product. The mockup will be updated here when it is completed.

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>I am really excited for the opportunity to help a small business move into the future in whatever way I can. I will continue to do my best to help this business succeed and reach their goals so that they may continue providing service in Chicago for years to come.</p>
