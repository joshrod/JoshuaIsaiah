						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Montoya Electric LLC is an electrical contractor company in Chicago, Illinois that provides commercial and residential electrical services in the area. They're a small, family-owned company with hopes of gaining more customers by targeting those who look online for their services.<br><br>
						Montoya Electric found customers through word-of-mouth. They use their Facebook page as their primary online presence, but it isn't very active with customers or business updates. While Facebook may be a good way to get the word out on your business, an inactive account defeats the purpose.</p>

						<h3>Mission</h3>
						<p>Having no original website to start with, I was given the guidelines of providing a clean, professional, yet simple design. It had to be easy to navigate and needed to work across all browsers, with an emphasis on older versions. This is because their target demographic is between the ages of 35 - 60, who have a higher chance of using outdated browsers.<br><br>
						When researching the immediate competition, we learned that their websites had little to no information and were used as placeholders to provide potential customers with their contact information. The best solution here was to make a static website with current info and multiple ways to contact the business via calls-to-action. Because Montoya Electric paid attention to their need for a website, they have the potential to get a leg up on their competitors.</p>

						<h3>Website Details</h3>
						<p>By default, the website is responsive and works across multiple browsers. The main goal of the website is to gain new customers, so I included multiple ways to contact the business that did not distract the user from the main content. The website consists of six main pages, with sections that alternate background colors so the user can easily differentiate when they arrive at a different one.<br><br>
						Almost every section has at least one picture with relevant information, allowing Montoya Electric to look professional and experienced in providing electrical services. The layouts of the sections are in line with modern design practices, using big pictures and ample white-space to keep things balanced and visually appealing.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>The biggest challenge I had to face while creating this website was not using flexbox. I even included a container with the class name '.flex-row'. I had to suck it up and get familiar with table displays using the container's children as table-cells to meet the requirements of the layouts.<br><br>
						This project provided a big step in solidifying a client process that works for me. Kickoff meeting, design, development, launch (with reviews in between each of course). I'm currently waiting for the client to send the pictures they want to use and their revisions of the current content. You can check out the code and the current state of the site in the meantime.</p>
