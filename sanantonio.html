						<p>Returning to San Antonio from Madison, looking through the Snapchat filters from my hometown was slightly underwhelming. I wasn't too happy with the lack of proper representation of the city itself, so I took on the challenge of filling the void with something I thought would do San Antonio justice.</p>

						<h3>Creating the Illustration</h3>
						<p>The two most important things that represented San Antonio were missing from the filters at the time: the Alamo and the Hemisfair Tower. While they were somewhat represented, they were only shown in silhouettes or as part of the skyline.<br><br>
						I wanted to include the most iconic buildings at the same time. Using the locations of each building in relation to each other, I had to depict the buildings at an angle. There was no need to change the color of the buildings since I was going for a more realistic illustration. Lastly, the red color for the banner is the same one that is used by the City of San Antonio.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>After submitting it to Snap Inc. for review in November 2016 and getting an approval two weeks later, I had to wait about two months before I began seeing it.<br><br>
						The metrics shown are from the beginning of April 2017. It is now in the rotation of filters for the city, which means that it is not available for use every day. Assuming it was available every day from January 1st, it still saw approximately 1477 uses and 79,000 views per day.<br><br>
						Those numbers are truly staggering. I'm glad that residents and tourists alike are enjoying the filter enough to show their friends. It's definitely a boost of confidence, and I hope to continue creating things that are well-received on a scale like this.
