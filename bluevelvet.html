						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>The Blue Velvet Lounge is a retro-themed bar established in 2001 that specializes in martinis. It's located in downtown Madison, an area heavily populated by students attending the two colleges located within a walking distance of the bar.<br><br>
						The business uses their page on Facebook as their main source of marketing and communication, making their website a secondary place for information. This poses a problem for potential new clients, who may get confused when they look up the bar on Google, and others who don't use Facebook or refuse to log in on their browsers.</p>

						<h3>Mission</h3>
						<p>The Blue Velvet Lounge's current website feels pretty outdated, in my opinion. The design choices are reminiscent of a time where all of the content needed to fit on one page. Also, the important information about their features, such as the menu, their upstairs lounge, and business hours is buried under wordy paragraphs prioritizing SEO and neglecting user experience.<br><br>
						While researching, I learned that most of the customers get their information about the bar from mobile devices either from Google or Facebook. With this knowledge, I decided to give this website a redesign to match more current trends and focus more on the experience of mobile users.</p>

						<h3>Website Details</h3>
						<p>Because the business does not depend on SEO to stay afloat, I went with a simple, single-page format. All of the content in the redesign is an expedited version of the content on the current website, with minor changes made to clear up confusion.<br><br>
						The sections are ordered like the live site, with minor adjustments to the placement of hours and address. I placed those items at the bottom so that customers get exposed to the features of the bar before losing interest and leaving the site.<br><br>
						The colors chosen are those representative of the business: navy blue and dark red. Using them as background colors made it easy for the white text to be readable. The chosen font is Lato with stark contrasts in weight to try adding balance to the typography.<br><br>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>Something to note about this specific design is the lack of quality, high-resolution pictures. I did the best I could with the pictures posted on Facebook, but for the website to really look its best, a photo session of the bar could help it reach the next level.<br><br>
						The interface of the website is the focal point of this project. It was presented to the General Manager with a positive reaction, pending changes and additions to the content. Turns out, the reason Facebook is the main marketing source for the bar is because the GM dislikes the design of the current website.<br><br>
						Sadly, bar politics have prevented this project from going forward. In the meantime, the design will be stored until it is needed, which may not be until the end of 2017.</p>
