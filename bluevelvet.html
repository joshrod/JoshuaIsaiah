				<div id="aboutbvtext">
					<p>The Blue Velvet Lounge is a retro-themed bar established in 2001 that specializes in martinis. It has lounge seating and opens up a dance floor upstairs on busy nights. While it's still around today, its marketing materials could use an update. As a former employee with nothing but positive experiences, this redesign is a token of my gratitude.</p>

					<h3>Updating the Logo</h3>
					<p>Overall, I wanted the logo to show that the bar was a classy place for martinis and dancing.<br><br>
					To achieve the feeling of class, I used sharp letters with a balanced variety of thickness for readability. The shape of the logo resembles that of a club, used to show that dancing takes place here. Finally, I put a minimal olive in the V to showcase the bar's best drink: the martini.</p>

					<h3>Creating the Website</h3>
					<p>As with the logo, the website needed to be modern, and primarily focus on martinis and fun. I also wanted the user to gather information quickly and easily without spending too much time looking for it.<br><br>
					A simple, single-page format was used to fulfill these requirements. In my experience, most users wanted to know "When? Where? What?" When is the bar open? Where is it? What do you serve?<br><br>
					The answers to these questions are located at the bottom of the page so that I would be able to present the bar's additional features to the user before they arrived there. Among these are the drinks served and the dance floor upstairs.</p>

					<h3>Going Forward</h3>
					<p>This is just a redesign for the moment. It was shown to the General Manager, who had a positive response. Hopefully, it can replace the current website the business has at the end of the year.<br><br>
					I previously programmed a fully functioning prototype of this site that I built upon to create this one. You can find the code for it in my <a href="https://github.com/joshrod" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.</p>
