						<p>Lambda Theta Phi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is a fraternity consisting of a group of men who have helped me develop professionally throughout my collegiate years.<br><br>
						Their increasing social media activity has been bringing traffic to the fraternity's profiles on Facebook and Instagram, where their website link is located in the descriptions. I was tasked to update their website so that it matches their strong online presence.

						<h3>Creating the Logo</h3>
						<p>The top logo is the one pertaining to the entire national fraternity. Using this as a basis, it was not necessary to change many things to make it fit the chapter at UW-Madison.<br><br>
						I used the same Gotham font, but thinner, to show the hierarchy between national and collegiate levels. This also allowed me to keep the shape of the logo as rectangular as possible using slight adjustments to the kerning of the text.</p>

						<h3>Creating the Website</h3>
						<p>The fraternity constantly puts forth many workshops, events, and community services that I thought should be primarily featured. The website was intended to serve as a newsletter and recruiting tool while providing information about the chapter.<br><br>
						The colors were specifically chosen to accurately reflect the ones used by the fraternity: brown and white. The shade of brown is darker than its default one so that the text could be easier to read against the white backgrounds of the website.<br><br>
						A five-page design was used so that information was available within two clicks. The front page is the newsletter, displayed as snippets of recent events that provide more information as the user scrolls down. It pertains to users of all kind, whether they are potential members or passersby.<br><br>
						As the user clicks through the links in the navigation bar, the information gets more esoteric. It starts by discovering information about the fraternity and ends by creating a call to action to contact the entity as a potential interest.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>It was almost on a whim. What started as a side-project became reality soon after I showed it to the fraternity. Due to a generous contribution from a fellow alumni, the website was given a domain and hosting. Click on the following link to check the website out for yourself. </p>
