					<p>With social media providing different ways to share information, it becomes imperative to adapt to them so businesses can reach a bigger audience. In the case of Latin Night, I was tasked to promote the Blue Velvet Lounge's weekly event using a Snapchat filter for clients to use during their attendance.</p>

					<h3>Creating the Illustration</h3>
					<p>The challenge in creating a Snapchat filter was that I wanted it to be simple, eye-catching, and it had to add to the picture or video taken on the app.<br><br>
					When I think of a Latin Night, I think of a tropical setting with a sunset and a palm tree. I used the sun to demonstrate the different colors it goes through until nighttime. A palm tree silhouette protruding slightly through the side was used to complete the setting. I used a cursive font for the title so that it continues round-shape of the illustration. The text for the business was an arced sans-serif font so that it could be easily readable up at the top. Lastly, I added a drop shadow to the font so that the text was readable in lighter areas of a picture or video.</p>

					<h3>"It Only Costs $5?!?"</h3>
					<p>It's all about the numbers. According to the metrics, the filter was swiped through 309 times, used 99 times, and seen 5,862 times on Snapchat.<br><br>
					What does this mean? Every time the filter was used, the picture or video was viewed 59 times. Unless there are dedicated individuals viewing the specific media that many times (highly unlikely), it proves that numerous users not in attendance are getting exposed to the business and its event.<br><br>
					On a personal note, seeing the filter used 99 times when the bar sees 150 unique customers, on average, was satisfying. It was a win-win situation, where the customers liked the design enough to use it on Snapchat, and the business gets promotion at the same time.</p>
