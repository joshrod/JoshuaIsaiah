						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Supermercado Latino is a yearly event at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that brings students together to celebrate the Latino culture on campus. To promote the event prior to the date, relevant marketing materials were needed that made full use of the avenues available, which consisted of Facebook and Instagram.</p>

						<h3>Design Details</h3>
						<p>A piece of parchment as the background made the colors used easily visible and went along with the cultural feeling I was going for. The "papel picado" on the top serves as the border for the event's name so that it is easily distinguishable from the information below it. Finally, I felt that it needed something recognizable to resonate with the students looking to attend. I placed a faint, well-known university building in the background to accomplish this task.<br><br>
						For the cover photo and Instagram post, the "papel picado" in the middle was not necessary. Instead, I used a top and bottom border of "papel picado" and kept the rest of the information in the center.</p>

						<h3>epilogue</h3>
						<p>Supermercado Latino 2013 was the organization's first event to fully employ Facebook and Instagram as marketing tactics. Prior to this, it was just about sharing the event and flyer on the Facebook News Feed.<br><br>
						With the inclusion of a cover photo along with the changes in Facebook's algorithm for sharing posts, the members were able to change their cover photos so that the event would appear on their friends' Facebook News Feed and on the member's personal profile at the same time.<br><br>
						Instagram opened a new avenue for event exposure, which was a tactic that the organization had not used before at the time. Members posted the square picture as another way to reach out to followers that may spend more time looking at pictures than profiles.<br><br>
